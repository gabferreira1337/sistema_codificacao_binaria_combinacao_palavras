#Binary_Encode_System_Sets_Words

##Description

This program aims to implement a system for managing sets of words and their corresponding UFP6 codes (binary encoding with custom ASCII). The implementation includes data structures, functions for word conversion, insertion and removal of words, exploration of combinations, word search, sorting, dynamic arrays, linked lists, and file input/output.

The application is designed to be used via function calls in a programming environment. There is no interactive interface or graphical user interface (CLI).

##Testing

Each functional requirement is accompanied by a specific test function that demonstrates the functionality associated with that requirement.

***All the required features for completing the project have been implemented***
